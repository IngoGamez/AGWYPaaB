# COMPILING THE GAME

# What you need:

# Included Files
You are going to need a few things before compiling our game. First, you will need to install the datafiles needed. These files can be found here ---> [Google Drive] *add links before launch lol*

# Gamemaker Steam Version
We use the Steam version of Gamemaker, but other versions may work too. If you experience issues using other versions of Gamemaker, try using the steam version, it may resolve those issues.

# Tutorial on Datafiles

Take the installed datafiles and drop the "datafiles" folder into the source code folder.

# Tutorial on Importing to Gamemaker

If you don't know how to import to Gamemaker, you need to click the import button on the home screen and navigate to where you put the source code. There, click on "AGWYPaaB.yyp". Dragging the .yyp file into the window might also work.
